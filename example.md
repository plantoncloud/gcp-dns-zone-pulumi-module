# Microservice Kubernetes Pulumi Module

## Overview

The **Microservice Kubernetes Pulumi Module** is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the deployment and management of microservices on Kubernetes clusters within a multi-cloud environment. Leveraging a Kubernetes-inspired API resource model, this module enables developers to define their microservice infrastructure as code using familiar Kubernetes-like structures. By integrating with Pulumi and Go, the module abstracts the complexities of Kubernetes operations, providing a standardized, scalable, and maintainable approach to managing microservices across various cloud providers.

## Key Features

### API Resource Features

- **Standardized Structure**: The `MicroserviceKubernetes` API resource follows a consistent schema with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. This uniformity ensures compatibility and ease of use within Kubernetes-like environments, facilitating seamless integration with existing workflows and tooling.

- **Configurable Specifications**:
  - **Environment Information**: Define the target environment using the `environmentInfo` field, specifying details such as `envId` to associate the microservice with the appropriate organizational context.
  - **Versioning**: Manage application versions through the `version` field, allowing for precise control over deployments and rollbacks.
  - **Container Configuration**:
    - **Image Specification**: Specify container images using the `repo` and `tag` fields, enabling flexible and efficient management of application binaries.
    - **Port Management**: Configure application ports with detailed settings including `appProtocol`, `containerPort`, `isIngressPort`, `networkProtocol`, and `servicePort`, ensuring proper networking and traffic routing.
    - **Resource Allocation**: Define resource requests and limits for CPU and memory, optimizing performance and resource utilization within the Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Environment Variables and Secrets**: Manage application configurations securely by specifying environment variables and integrating with secrets managers for sensitive data.

- **Validation and Compliance**: Incorporates validation rules to ensure that all configurations adhere to required standards and best practices, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing overall system reliability.

### Pulumi Module Features

- **Automated Kubernetes Provider Setup**: Utilizes provided credentials and configurations to set up the Pulumi Kubernetes provider, enabling seamless interaction with Kubernetes clusters across different cloud environments.

- **Microservice Deployment**: Automates the deployment of microservices by interpreting the `MicroserviceKubernetes` API resource specifications. This includes creating and managing Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, and Ingresses based on the defined configurations.

- **Resource Management**:
  - **Container Management**: Handles the creation and configuration of containerized applications, ensuring that specified images, ports, and resource allocations are correctly applied.
  - **Networking Configuration**: Manages the setup of network protocols and port mappings, facilitating proper communication between services and external clients.
  - **Environment Variable Injection**: Integrates environment variables and secrets into the deployed containers, enabling dynamic configuration and secure handling of sensitive information.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to support a wide range of microservice architectures, the module accommodates varying levels of complexity and can be easily extended to meet evolving infrastructure needs.

- **Exported Stack Outputs**: Provides essential outputs such as deployment statuses, service endpoints, and resource identifiers. These outputs are captured in `status.stackOutputs`, facilitating integration with other infrastructure components and enabling effective monitoring and management.

- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that any issues encountered during deployment are promptly identified and reported, aiding in swift troubleshooting and maintaining infrastructure integrity.

## Installation

To integrate the Microservice Kubernetes Pulumi Module into your project, clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo/microservice-kubernetes-pulumi-module). Ensure that you have Pulumi and Go installed and properly configured in your development environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/microservice-kubernetes-pulumi-module.git
cd microservice-kubernetes-pulumi-module
```

## Usage

Refer to the [example section](#examples) for usage instructions.

## Module Details

### Input Configuration

The module expects a `MicroserviceKubernetesStackInput` which includes:

- **Pulumi Input**: Configuration details required by Pulumi for managing the stack.
- **Target API Resource**: The `MicroserviceKubernetes` resource defining the desired microservice configuration.
- **Kubernetes Credentials**: Specifications for the Kubernetes credentials used to authenticate and authorize Pulumi operations.

### Exported Outputs

Upon successful execution, the module exports the following outputs to `status.stackOutputs`:

- **Deployment Status**: Information regarding the deployment status of the microservice.
- **Service Endpoints**: The endpoints exposed by the microservice, facilitating access and integration with other services.
- **Resource Identifiers**: Unique identifiers for the deployed Kubernetes resources, enabling precise management and monitoring.

These outputs enable seamless integration with other components of your infrastructure and provide essential information for monitoring and management purposes.
